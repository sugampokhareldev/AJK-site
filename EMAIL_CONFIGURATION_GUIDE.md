# üìß Email Configuration Guide

## **üîç NOTIFICATION_EMAIL vs ADMIN_EMAILS**

### **NOTIFICATION_EMAIL**
- **Purpose:** Single primary admin email for notifications
- **Usage:** When you want to send notifications to ONE admin email
- **Format:** Single email address
- **Example:** `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=admin@yourcompany.com`

### **ADMIN_EMAILS**
- **Purpose:** Multiple admin emails for notifications
- **Usage:** When you want to send notifications to MULTIPLE admin emails
- **Format:** Comma-separated list of email addresses
- **Example:** `ADMIN_EMAILS=admin1@company.com,admin2@company.com,manager@company.com`

## **üì¨ What Notifications Are Sent?**

Both `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_EMAILS` receive the same types of notifications:

### **1. New Booking Alerts**
- When customers book cleaning services
- Includes customer details, service type, date/time
- Sent to all configured admin emails

### **2. New Review Alerts**
- When customers submit reviews
- Includes review text, rating, customer info
- Sent to all configured admin emails

### **3. Quote Request Alerts**
- When customers request quotes
- Includes customer requirements and contact info
- Sent to all configured admin emails

### **4. Payment Confirmations**

- Sent to all configured admin emails

### **5. Custom Message Alerts**
- When admins send custom messages to customers
- Includes message content and customer info
- Sent to all configured admin emails

## **üîß Configuration Priority**

The system checks for admin emails in this order:

1. **ADMIN_EMAILS** (if set) - Uses comma-separated list
2. **NOTIFICATION_EMAIL** (if set) - Uses single email
3. **Default fallback** - Uses `sugampokharel28@gmail.com`

## **üí° When to Use Which?**

### **Use NOTIFICATION_EMAIL when:**
- You have ONE admin managing everything
- You want simple configuration
- You're the sole owner/manager

**Example:**
```bash
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=owner@cleaningcompany.com
```

### **Use ADMIN_EMAILS when:**
- You have MULTIPLE admins/managers
- You want notifications sent to a team
- You have different people handling different aspects

**Example:**
```bash
ADMIN_EMAILS=owner@company.com,manager@company.com,bookings@company.com
```

## **üöÄ Render.com Setup**

### **Option 1: Single Admin Email**
```
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
```

### **Option 2: Multiple Admin Emails**
```
ADMIN_EMAILS=admin1@gmail.com,admin2@gmail.com,manager@gmail.com
```

### **Option 3: Mixed Configuration**
```
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=primary-admin@gmail.com
ADMIN_EMAILS=admin1@gmail.com,admin2@gmail.com,backup-admin@gmail.com
